    <p class="p">On day 2 I woke up at 8:45am extremely tired. The night before had ended in a violent dream of being stalked. I took a nap at 1pm, where the terrifying dreams continued. The details of the dream were difficult to recall, but the feelings felt were crystal clear. I woke up gasping, still feeling residual emotions of terror, panic, paranoia, and fear.<br><br>
    I did not record what I was looking at on my phone before I went down for a nap. However, I usually check Instagram and Twitter (where I get most of my news) first thing in the mornings. The top story of the day was Ontario officially moving into the third State of Emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
