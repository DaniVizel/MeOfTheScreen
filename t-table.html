    <p class="p">On day 5, I spent 2 hours and 38 minutes in bed at night. Instead of spending the time on social media like I usually do, I used Google, Pinterest, Amazon, and my To Do list app to do some online shopping. I was looking at several websites (including Old Navy) for some basic t-shirts specifically. I went to sleep at 4:20am immediately after saving several tabs with items I liked.<br><br>
    That night, I dreamt that I walked into an Old Navy store and looked at a rectangular table of folded t-shirts. The patterns on the shirts perfectly matched the designs I saved on my phone before going to sleep. Within the dream I immediately recognized the familiar designs as the same ones I liked before falling asleep. </p>
