    <p class="p" id="ford-det-p">On day 10, I spent 57 minutes in bed using Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter (for news) and played some sudoku. One of the top stories earlier that day was Ontario Premier Doug Ford's announcement that police officers "will have the authority to require any individual to provide their home address and purpose for not being at their residence" effective the following morning.<br><br>
    That night, I dreamt that I was at a busy indoor water park, filled with strangers. A large number of Ford government's representatives arrived to the pool, all dressed in professional office wear. Soon after, other people of the community gathered in opposition, turning the gathering into a peaceful protest. In the dream, I found a megaphone and joined the opposing side, trying to voice how their policies were harming minority groups. Then the protest took a turn, becoming violent and deadly. It was gruesome, gory, and bloody. The most prominent feelings in the dream were not terror, but rejection, desperation, ostracism, and feeling shunned. </p>
