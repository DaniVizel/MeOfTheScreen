    <h1>TECHNOLOGY <em>&amp</em> THE SUBCONSCIOUS</h1>

    <h3 id="subhead-1">THE RESEARCH</h3>
        <p id="p1">The first thing I look at when I open my eyes and the last thing before falling asleep is always my smartphone. I have a feeling I’m no where near alone in this behavior. Seemingly unrelated, I happen to have ultra vivid dreams due to a prescription medication side effect. With these two facts, I, a second year Graphic Design student at OCADU, decided to track which images and themes are created by my subconscious to see if there might be any recognizable correlation between it and the digital content I consume in bed.</p>
        <p id="p2">The data collection process involved documenting the time spent using my phone while in bed shortly after waking up, and right before going to sleep. First thing in the morning, I used my phone’s notes app to recall as many details of my dreams as I could, as well as what emotions/feelings were present in them. I also used a sleep tracker app which used microphone data to track my movement in bed in an attempt to estimate the quality of sleep overall. The data collection process went on for 14 days.</p>
    
    <h3 id="subhead-2">THE ANECDOTAL FINDINGS</h3>
        <p id="p3">Some of the results were as predicted. A few topics that appeared in the dreams directly reflected, or built upon ideas I was thinking about before bed. This most often occurred following evening conversations with friends, either over text (most often Snapchat) or in a call (Discord). Occasionally, dreams featured subjects that were on my to-do list, such as shopping to replace an article of clothing, or even being aware within the dream that I will be documenting what I saw when I woke up.</p>
        <p id="p4">Other findings however, were rather surprising.  The vast majority of dreams involved negative feelings, even if the imagery itself was not inherently unpleasant. The more negative subjects were often related to current events or local news, however I spent little time consuming news (on Twitter) in bed, which may suggest that my evening dreams were reflecting thoughts and feelings from technology usage as early as late morning or early afternoon. </p>
        <p id="p5">Other notable findings include: there is no visible connection between the duration of phone usage in bed and the presence of dreams, I experienced noticeably lower energy and mood the day following a negative dream, and the consumption of Instagram content seems to result in more creative or fantastical imagery in dreams.</p>

    <h3 id="subhead-3">EXPLORE</h3>
        <p id="p6">Consider reflecting on your own technology usage around bedtime as you explore my findings. How is your quality of sleep? Do you have any dreams? Are there any recurring themes? Perhaps even track your own patterns of digital interaction and see how you match up to my results. </p>
